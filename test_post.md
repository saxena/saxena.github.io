=Adventures of an Idle Processor=

Processors are designed to execute instructions. Instructions perform
mathematical or logical operations on data stored in the memories
associated with the processor, other instructions move data round from
one location to another in the memories. Instructions themselves are
stored in memories and a subset of instructions exist to cause the
processor to changes the memory location from where the instructions
are read.

However, a type of instruction that stands in a world of its own is
the 'null' instruction. Often such instructions are called by other
names such as "HALT", "NOP" (no operation) or "WAIT". They stand out
because theese instructions are designed to actually do nothing.

Well, one might ask, "What causes a processor to execute instructions
in the first place? "
