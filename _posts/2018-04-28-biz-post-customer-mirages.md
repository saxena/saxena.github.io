title: The Search for Customers
---

Preface
-------

The sole purpose of a new business venture is survival. The main
activity that is necessary for survival is the act of customers paying
for the products sold by the business for money.

A Story
-------

In a recent conversation with a business founder we were talking about
his company's quest at finding customers for their product. They
explained to me how, there was tremendous interest in their
product.


There were letters of intent to start a pilot. And these letters came
from several companies. Early product prototypes were being
readied. The founder was seeing positive signs. However, I was feeling
paranoid. I conveyed my sense of hesitation with the following
analogy. It sounds quaint, but I knew the founder well enough to know
that they could take this to heart.


The founders are travelers through a desert. They need to find water
to re-fill their supplies so that they can continue their journey. The
founders can see a distant body of water. One founder leaves on a
scouting trip to investigate.


On returning back, the founder was excited and claims that on walking
towards the water body, they could see a lake that was even bigger
than was first visible and that there is a whole oasis around the
lake. They should move in that direction immediately.


At this point, I told the founder, that the only way to tell whether
they were actually heading to a real oasis, was for one of them to go
to the lake and be able to drink the water. Anything less was proof
that what they are seeing was a mirage.


Either, be able to drink the water, or abandon the quest in that
direction after a pre-determined period of effort.
